# Zero-To-Hero-Advent-Of-Code
This repo includes every topic I covered for my quant finance advent of code. It is designed so anyone can follow it for free, and if you don't want to use python the first video sets it up so you could only use it once. I tried to make it dynamic, fun, and for every experience level!

This is my YouTube playlist to follow along https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYnM2OmJI4&list=PLaXsBdJZLRmXC1uFWqh7l_q-468vq-tDq&index=25
